Why might you still want to use GPG  encryption for your emails on top of the encryption provided by SSH?  §A. The SSH tunnel reaches only as far as the first email server; GPG encrypts data on all  of the computers all the way to or from your email correspondents.  §B. SSH encryption is notoriously poor for email, although it’s perfectly adequate for login  sessions; thus, adding GPG encryption improves security.  §C.
