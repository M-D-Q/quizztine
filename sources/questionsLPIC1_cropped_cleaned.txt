You discover that one process, dfcomp, is consuming more than 90 percent of your  system’s CPU time. What can you conclude?  §A. Very little: dfcomp could be legitimately consuming that much CPU time, or it could be  an unauthorized or malfunctioning program.  §B. No program should consume 90 percent of available CPU time; dfcomp is clearly  malfunctioning and should be terminated.  §C. This is normal; dfcomp is the kernel’s main scheduling process, and it consumes any  unused CPU time.  §D. This behavior is normal if your CPU is less powerful than a 2.5 GHz EM64T Pentium.  However, on newer systems, no program should consume 90 percent of CPU time.  §E. This behavior is normal if your CPU has at least four cores, but on systems with fewer  cores than this, no program should consume 90 percent of CPU time.          £18. You type jobs at a bash command prompt and receive a new command prompt with no  intervening output. What can you conclude?  §A. The total CPU time used by your processes is negligible (below 0.1).  §B. No processes are running under your username except the shell that you’re using.  §C.

The disk contains two primary partitions and two extended partitions.  §B. Either /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 is an extended partition.  §C. The partition table is corrupted; there should be a /dev/sda3 and a /dev/sda4 before  /dev/sda5.  §D. If you add a /dev/sda3 with fdisk, /dev/sda5 will become /dev/sda6, and /dev/  sda6 will become /dev/sda7.  §E. Both /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 are logical partitions.  £7. A new Linux administrator plans to create a system with separate /home, /usr/local, and  /etc partitions, in addition to the root (/) partition. Which of the following best describes  this configuration?  §A. The system won’t boot because critical boot-time files reside in /home.  §B. The system will boot, but /usr/local won’t be available because mounted partitions  must be mounted directly off their parent partition, not in a subdirectory.  §C. The system will boot only if the /home partition is on a separate physical disk from the  /usr/local partition.  §D. The system will boot and operate correctly, provided each partition is large enough for  its intended use.  §E.

The disk is corrupt; those partition type codes are incompatible.  §E. The disk holds a Mac OS X installation.          £10. You run Linux’s fdisk and modify your partition layout. Before exiting the program, you  realize that you’ve been working on the wrong disk. What can you do to correct this problem?  §A.

Windows’s FDISK uses GUI controls, whereas Linux’s fdisk uses a command-line  interface, but they have similar functionality.  §D. Despite their similar names, they’re completely different tools—the Windows FDISK  command handles disk partitioning, whereas Linux’s fdisk formats floppy disks.  §E. The Windows FDISK command manages GPT disks, whereas Linux’s fdisk manages  MBR disks. £13. What mount point should you associate with swap partitions?  §A. /  §B. /swap  §C. /boot  §D. /mem  §E.

You’re configuring a new system, and your network administrator scribbles its IP address  (172.25.78.89), netmask (255.255.255.0), gateway address (172.25.79.1), and DNS server  address (10.24.89.201) on a piece of paper. You enter this information into your configura-  tion files and type ifup eth0, but you find that you can’t access the Internet with this  computer. Which of the following is definitely true?  §A. Because the DNS server is on a completely different network, it won’t function properly  for your system. You should ask for the local network’s DNS server’s IP address.  §B. The netmask identifies the gateway as being on a different network segment than the  computer you’re configuring, so the two can’t communicate directly. You most likely  misread one address.  §C. Because the IP addresses involved are private IP addresses, there’s no way for them to  access the Internet. You must ask for public IP addresses for this system or use only  your local private network.  §D. The computer’s IP address is a Class B address, but the netmask is for a Class C  address. This combination can’t work together, so you must obtain a new IP address or  netmask.  §E. The ifup utility works only for computers that use DHCP, so using a static IP address  as specified in the question won’t work correctly.  £17. What is the purpose of the -n option to route?  §A.

It holds the routing table for the computer, determining the route that network packets  take to other computers.  §E. It sets the computer’s default search domain and identifies (by IP address) the name  servers that the computer may use.  £19. Which of the following entries are found in the /etc/hosts file?  §A.

Edit the /etc/named.conf file, and change the preferred-resolution option from  files to dns.  §D. Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf, and change the order of the files and dns options on the  hosts: line.  §E.

It specifies the filename of the text editor that bash uses by default while you’re enter-  ing commands at its prompt.  §C. If you type edit filename at a command prompt, the program specified by EDITOR  will be launched.  §D. If it’s set to GUI, programs call a GUI editor; if it’s set to TEXT, programs call a text-  based editor.  §E. Some programs refer to EDITOR to determine what external editor to launch when they  need to launch one.  £4. In what environment variable is the current working directory stored?  §A. PATH  §B.

It copies the contents of big.cc to big.c, eliminating the old big.c.  §D. It converts the C program big.c into a C++ program called big.cc.  §E.

An email with the subject of Error and the contents from /tmp/msg is sent to the local  users root and abort.           §C. An email with the subject of Error and the contents of /tmp/msg is sent to the local  user root, and then the script is aborted.  §D. An email is sent with Error priority to the local user root, and the email system is  then shut down with error messages being stored in /tmp/msg.  §E.

Typing lsof -i | grep LISTEN as root produces three lines of output, corresponding  to the sendmail, sshd, and proftpd servers. What can you conclude about the security of  this system?  §A. Everything is OK; the presence of sshd ensures that data are being encrypted via SSH.  §B. The sendmail and sshd servers are OK, but the FTP protocol used by proftpd is  insecure and should never be used.  §C. The sendmail server should be replaced by Postfix or qmail for improved security, but  sshd and proftpd are fine.  §D.
