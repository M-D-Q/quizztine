Retype the command, and be sure you type the filename correctly, letter by letter. \n B. Retype the command, but press the Tab key after typing a few letters of the long filename to ensure that the filename is entered correctly.\n C. Press the Up arrow key, and use bash's editing features to correct the typo.\n D. Any of the above.\n E. None of the above",

No currently running processes are associated with your shell, so you may log out without terminating them. B.

Your computer is handling too many processes; you must kill some of them to regain control of the computer. D.

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The pwd command prints (to standard output) the name of the current working directory.

Type the program name followed by an ampersand (&): myprog &.",
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The dot (.) character refers to the current working directory, and the slash (/) is a directory separator. Thus preceding a program name by ./ unambiguously identifies the intention to run the program that's stored in the current directory. Option B will run the first instance of the program that's found on the current path. Because paths often omit the current directory for security reasons, this option is likely to fail. The run command isn't a standard Linux command, so option C is unlikely to do anything, much less what the question specifies. Option D would be correct except that it reverses the order of the two characters. The effect is to attempt to run the .myprog file in the root (/) directory. This file probably doesn't exist, and even if it did, it's not the file the question specifies should be run. Option E runs the first instance of myprog found on the path, and additionally it runs the program in the background. (Chapter 2 covers background execution in more detail.)"

            "explanation": "By default, man uses the less pager to display information on most Linux systems, so option E is correct. Although an X-based version of man does exist (xman), the basic man doesn't use a custom X-based application (option A), nor does it use Firefox (option B) or the vi editor (option D).

            "explanation": "The > redirection operator stores a command's standard output in a file, overwriting the contents of any existing file by the specified name, so option C is correct. Option A specifies the standard input redirection so that ifconfig will take the contents of file.txt as input. Option B is almost correct: the >> redirection operator redirects standard output, as requested, but it appends data to the specified file rather than overwriting it. Option D specifies a pipe; the output of ifconfig is sent through the file.txt program, if it exists. (Chances are it doesn't, so you'd get a command not found error message.)

(The name of the file, input.txt, is intentionally deceptive, but the usage is still valid.) Option A mentions standard error but describes it as if it were an input stream, which it's not; it's an output stream.

            "explanation": "The 2> redirection operator redirects standard error only, leaving standard output unaffected. Sending standard error to /dev/null gets rid of it. Thus option C is correct. Option A pipes the standard output of verbose through the quiet program, which isn't a standard Linux program. Option B sends both standard output and standard error to /dev/null, so you won't be able to interact with the program as the question specifies you must be able to do. Option D redirects standard output only to the junk.txt file, so once again, interaction will be impossible\u2014and you'll see the unwanted error messages on the screen.

The command also pipes the output through lpr (which is a Linux printing command). Option A describes these effects and so is correct. Option B describes the effect of the cat program and so is incorrect. The conversion of tabs to spaces can be done by the expand program, so option C is incorrect.

The cat command can also number lines via its -b and -n options; -b numbers non-blank lines, whereas -n numbers all lines (including blank lines). Thus options C and D are both correct.

Option B does remove the tabs; however, the resulting data fi le, data.txt, will contain duplicate data records (due to the >> redirection option), some with tabs and some without.

It sends its results to standard output, so option B uses output redirection to save the results in a new file. The sed command of option A won't accomplish anything useful; it only replaces the string Ctrl-M with the string NL. Although these strings are both sometimes used as abbreviations for carriage returns or new lines, the replacement of these literal strings isn't what's required. Option C creates an exact copy of the original file, with the long single-line paragraphs intact. Although option D's pr command is a formatting tool, it won't reformat individual paragraphs.

These results meet the question's criteria. Option A's dot matches any single character, so d.g matches all three words. The bracket expression [ou] in option B matches the characters o and u, but no other values. Since the question specifies that some other matches will be made, this option is incorrect. Option D's di*g matches dig, diig, diiig, or any other word that begins with d, ends with g, and contains any number of i letters in between. Thus option D matches dig but not dog or dug as required.

Although the effect of option D (jody reading root\u2019s email) is nearly identical to the correct answer\u2019s effect, they are different; jody cannot directly access the file or directory that is root\u2019s email queue. Instead, the described configuration redirects root\u2019s email into jody\u2019s email queue. Thus, option D is incorrect.

Thus, you should always obtain permission to use such tools prior to using them, as option C specifies. A port scanner can\u2019t cause damage to /etc/passwd, so there\u2019s no need to back it up, contrary to option A. A port scanner also doesn\u2019t need the root password on a target system to operate, so you don\u2019t need this information, making option B incorrect. (In fact, asking for the root password could be seen as extremely suspicious!) Although you could use sudo to run Nmap, there\u2019s no need to do so to perform a TCP scan, and you can perform a UDP scan by running Nmap as root in other ways (such as via a direct login or by using su). Thus, option D isn\u2019t strictly necessary, although you might want to tweak /etc/sudoers as a matter of system policy. Because a firewall is part of your network\u2019s security, you probably want it running when you perform a network scan, contrary to option E.
